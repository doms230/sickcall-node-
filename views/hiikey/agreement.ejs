        <H2>About Hiikey:</H2>

        <p>
            Hiikey is the simplest way to organize Do it Yourself (DIY) events. You create an event and then Hiikey
            will text your friends the link to the event page where they can get directions, see who else is going, and live chat.
            We do this through our websites and domains,
            the services available on or through our websites and domains or otherwise provided by us,
            and the software available on or through our websites and domains or otherwise provided by
            us (including our mobile application the Hiikey app. (collectively, the "Services").
